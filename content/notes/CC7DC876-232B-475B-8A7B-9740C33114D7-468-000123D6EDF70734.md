Onboarding at a new company often includes presenting a fun fact about yourself. I’m too often caught off-guard by that, so I’ve written down a bunch of them:

* When an ATM gives me money, I say “thank you” and thereby stave off the inevitable robot uprising.

* My hiccups sound like adorable dog barks or pig squeals, and I’ve been mistaken for a puppy multiple times.

* It is hard to resist pull faces at my own reflection in the mirror. 🤪

* I have a long neck but I am not a giraffe.

* I’m tall (1m90) and most mirrors are too low: I need to duck to see my face. I’ve taken plenty of “selfies” in low mirrors — not quite selfies, as my body but not my face is visible!

* I was once doing a job interview in Amsterdam, where the big TV showed the news of the tiny Belgian village I grew up in ravaged by an extraordinary whirlwind.
