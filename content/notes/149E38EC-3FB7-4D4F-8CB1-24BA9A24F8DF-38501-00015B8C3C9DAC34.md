This is my second month at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). Still thinking that this is the start of a stable, long-lasting career with plenty of growth opportunities!

I continue to rebuild my web site. I’ve identified the [[Audience of my web site]], and have a reasonable idea of what I want the [[Contents of my web site]] to be. This will change over time though, and course I am rather happy to have a [pretty darn good static-site generator](https://nanoc.ws/) that makes playing around with my site easy!
