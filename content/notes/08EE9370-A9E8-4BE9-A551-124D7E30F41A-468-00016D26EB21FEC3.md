The same functionality appears in different programming languages under different names. Here’s a (probably rather futile) attempt at gathering some interesting distinctions.

## Remove/keep elements matching predicate from array
* `filter` (what is the opposite though?)
* `select` + `reject` (Smalltalk, Ruby)
* `dropWhere` + `keepWhere` (I invented these)

## Map elements
This applies a map to the elements of an array.

* `map`
* `collect` (Smalltalk, Ruby)

## Map values
This applies a map to the values of a hash/dict/map.

* `transform_values` (Ruby)
